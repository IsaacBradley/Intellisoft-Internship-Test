This text file outlines the SQL scripts for creating the database and its tables and columns.
I've named my database as 'internshipract'

I've done the web form using;
  FRONTEND: Html, Bootstrap, javascript and CSS
  BACKEND: PHP
  DATABASE: MYSQL
  SERVER: WAMP localhost server
  
  
Once you open the mySQL console on your localhost server, type the following commands;
  
  show databases; (to show all the databases hosted in your localhost server)
  create database 'database_name'; (to create a database)
  create table 'table_name'(
  lastname varchar(191) not null,
  firstname varchar(191) not null,
  middlename varchar(191) not null,
  gender varchar(20) not null,
  race varchar(20) not null,
  age int(20) not null,
  dob varchar(50) not null,
  facilityname varchar(50) not null,
  city varchar(50) not null,
  county varchar(50) not null,
  state varchar(50) not null,
  phonenumber varchar(15) not null,
  street varchar(50) not null
  );
  
  AFTER YOU CLICK ENTER, A TABLE WILL HAVE BEEN CREATED WITH COLUMN NAMES THAT WILL ACOMMODATE
  THE DATA IN THE FORM THAT WE HAVE CREATED IN THE WEBSITE
